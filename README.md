# CentoSync

CentoSync is a web application that synchronizes video playback with Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) using MIDI Time Code (MTC) or MIDI Clock with Song Position Pointer (SPP).

CentoSync has been tested with:

- Bitwig Studio 5.2
  - MTC
  - SPP
- Reason Studio 12
  - SPP
- FL Studio 2024
  - MTC with CentoSync's Alternative Start/Stop checkbox enabled

  - SPP

Other DAWs, and new/previous versions of the listed DAWs should works fine as well.

MTC is the default and recommended mode.
