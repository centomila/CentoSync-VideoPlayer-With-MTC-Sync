## Why this project exists

- I'm learning the ins and outs of webmidi.js.
- My DAW of choice doesn't support natively video and this is one step to code an alternative solution to the existing ones. Follow me on GitHub to see when it's ready ðŸ˜‰

You can install MTC Timecode using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

After you have started the server:
